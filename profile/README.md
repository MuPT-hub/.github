# The Multiscale Polymer Toolkit (MuPT)

The multiscale polymer toolkit is a collaborative infrastructure to expand the ability of the polymer research community to understand structure- function relationships in polymers with multiscale molecular modeling and simulations. 

The project is funded by the National Science Foundation, under grants OAC-2411302, OAC-2411303, OAC-2411304, OAC-2411305, and OAC-2411306.

To get started, try the tutorials.
